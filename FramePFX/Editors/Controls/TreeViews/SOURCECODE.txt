This is a heavy modification of the MultiSelectTreeView library,
where ItemsSource is not supported for typical MVVM usage.

This is the Github link of an (old) fork that I created with some fixes,
but doesn't match this project's source for the tree view:
https://github.com/AngryCarrot789/MultiSelectTreeView

The licence for the library is contained in the source files of this directory
