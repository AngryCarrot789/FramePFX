A small video editor

I started making this because other editors like vegas, prmiere pro, etc, just seem to run so slowly 
and some of them just lack basic features (e.g zoom in the view port with CTRL + MouseWheel)

I doubt this will ever even come close to those editors... but hopefully this will at least support "editing" videos, even if it's just cutting up clips
